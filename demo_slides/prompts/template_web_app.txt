You are building a single-use web app to explore **my** data. Keep everything local (no external services).

Project brief (fill in):
- Goal / decision: <what I’m trying to learn or decide>
- Audience: <who will use it>
- Constraints: <offline/online, libraries allowed, file size limits, styling prefs>

Data briefing (fill in):
- File(s) + formats: <paths, csv/json/xlsx>
- Each row represents: <e.g., one message, one thread>
- Columns (name:type:meaning): <col1:type:meaning>, <col2:type:meaning>, ...
- Sample rows (2–5): <paste tiny samples>
- Sensitive fields (do NOT show or store): <list or “none”>

Must build:
- Views: <charts/tables/filters you already know you want>
- Interactions: <e.g., filter by date/region, click thread to open detail>
- UX: chat-style bubbles for prompt/response; user right, AI left. Keep controls on the side.
- Outputs: single HTML (no build step), inlined CSS/JS, plus synthetic fallback data when real files are missing.

Research questions to answer:
- <Q1>
- <Q2>
- Optional: “Surprise me with one extra view that helps answer these.”

Deliverables:
- HTML file (self-contained)
- Short run instructions (e.g., `python -m http.server 8000`)
